This module is the single source of truth for the marker-insensitive free-marker
stripper: it imports only :mod:`re` and performs no I/O, configuration loading,
credential resolution or SDK import. ``build_site.strip_free_marker`` and
``mcp_server.strip_free_marker`` re-export this exact function object rather
than carrying a second copy.
